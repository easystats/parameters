This submission fixes CRAN check failures (related to the last *datawizard* update).

We checked all reverse dependencies, comparing R CMD check results across CRAN
and dev versions of this package.

 * We saw 1 new problems: *cvms*
 
We have already informed the maintainer of this breaking change and he is prepared to submit a new version of *cvms* to CRAN once *parameters* update is accepted on CRAN.
