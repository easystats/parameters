	abstract = {All scientific interpretations of statistical outputs depend on background (auxiliary) assumptions that are rarely delineated or explicitly interrogated. These include not only the usual modeling assumptions, but also deeper assumptions about the data-generating mechanism that are implicit in conventional statistical interpretations yet are unrealistic in most health, medical and social research. We provide arguments and methods for reinterpreting statistics such as P-values and interval estimates in unconditional terms, which describe compatibility of observations with an entire set of underlying assumptions, rather than with a narrow target hypothesis conditional on the assumptions. Emphasizing unconditional interpretations helps avoid overconfident and misleading inferences in light of uncertainties about the assumptions used to arrive at the statistical results. These include not only mathematical assumptions, but also those about absence of systematic errors, protocol violations, and data corruption. Unconditional descriptions introduce assumption uncertainty directly into the primary statistical interpretations of results, rather than leaving it for the discussion of limitations after presentation of conditional interpretations. The unconditional approach does not entail different methods or calculations, only different interpretation of the usual results. We view use of unconditional description as a vital component of effective statistical training and presentation. By interpreting statistical outputs in unconditional terms, researchers can avoid making overconfident statements based on statistical outputs. Instead, reports should emphasize the compatibility of results with a range of plausible explanations, including assumption violations.},

	abstract = {Turmoil has engulfed psychological science. Causes and consequences of the reproducibility crisis are in dispute. With the hope of addressing some of its aspects, Bayesian methods are gaining increasing attention in psychological science. Some of their advantages, as opposed to the frequentist framework, are the ability to describe parameters in probabilistic terms and explicitly incorporate prior knowledge about them into the model. These issues are crucial in particular regarding the current debate about statistical significance. Bayesian methods are not necessarily the only remedy against incorrect interpretations or wrong conclusions, but there is an increasing agreement that they are one of the keys to avoid such fallacies. Nevertheless, its flexible nature is its power and weakness, for there is no agreement about what indices of “significance” should be computed or reported. This lack of a consensual index or guidelines, such as the frequentist p-value, further contributes to the unnecessary opacity that many non-familiar readers perceive in Bayesian statistics. Thus, this study describes and compares several Bayesian indices, provide intuitive visual representation of their “behavior” in relationship with common sources of variance such as sample size, magnitude of effects and also frequentist significance. The results contribute to the development of an intuitive understanding of the values that researchers report, allowing to draw sensible recommendations for Bayesian statistics description, critical for the standardization of scientific reporting.},
