\title{Degrees of Freedom (DoF)}
\usage{
degrees_of_freedom(model, ...)

\method{degrees_of_freedom}{default}(model, method = "analytical", ...)

dof(model, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{A statistical model.}

\item{...}{Currently not used.}

\item{method}{Can be \code{"analytical"} (default, DoFs are estimated based on the model type), \code{"fit"}, in which case they are directly taken from the model if available (for Bayesian models, the goal (looking for help to make it happen) would be to refit the model as a frequentist one before extracting the DoFs), \code{"ml1"} (see \code{\link{dof_ml1}}), \code{"betwithin"} (see \code{\link{dof_betwithin}}), \code{"satterthwaite"} (see \code{\link{dof_satterthwaite}}), \code{"kenward"} (see \code{\link{dof_kenward}}) or \code{"any"}, which tries to extract DoF by any of those methods, whichever succeeds.}
}
\description{
Estimate or extract degrees of freedom of models parameters.
}
\details{
Methods for calculating degrees of freedom:
\itemize{
\item \code{"analytical"} for models of class \code{lmerMod}, Kenward-Roger approximated degrees of freedoms are calculated, for other models, \code{n-k} (number of observations minus number of parameters).
\item \code{"fit"} tries to extract residual degrees of freedom, and returns \code{Inf} if residual degrees of freedom could not be extracted.
\item \code{"any"} first tries to extract residual degrees of freedom, and if these are not available, extracts analytical degrees of freedom.
\item \code{"nokr"} same as \code{"analytical"}, but does not Kenward-Roger approximation for models of class \code{lmerMod}. Instead, always uses \code{n-k} to calculate df for any model.
\item \code{"wald"} returns \code{Inf}.
\item \code{"kenward"} calls \code{\link{dof_kenward}}.
\item \code{"satterthwaite"} calls \code{\link{dof_satterthwaite}}.
\item \code{"ml1"} calls \code{\link{dof_ml1}}.
\item \code{"betwithin"} calls \code{\link{dof_betwithin}}.
}
For models with z-statistic, the returned degrees of freedom for model parameters is \code{Inf} (unless \code{method = "ml1"} or \code{method = "betwithin"}), because there is only one distribution for the related test statistic.
