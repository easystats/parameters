\arguments{
\item{model}{Statistical Model.}

\item{ci_levels}{Vector of scalars, indicating the different levels at which
compatibility intervals should be printed or plotted. In plots, these levels
are highlighted by vertical lines. It is possible to increase thickness for
one or more of these lines by providing a names vector, where the to be
highlighted values should be named \code{"emph"}, e.g
\code{ci_levels = c(0.25, 0.5, emph = 0.95)}.}

\item{exponentiate}{Logical, indicating whether or not to exponentiate the
coefficients (and related confidence intervals). This is typical for
logistic regression, or more generally speaking, for models with log or
logit links. It is also recommended to use \code{exponentiate = TRUE} for models
with log-transformed response values. \strong{Note:} Delta-method standard
errors are also computed (by multiplying the standard errors by the
transformed coefficients). This is to mimic behaviour of other software
packages, such as Stata, but these standard errors poorly estimate
uncertainty for the transformed coefficient. The transformed confidence
interval more clearly captures this uncertainty. For \code{compare_parameters()},
\code{exponentiate = "nongaussian"} will only exponentiate coefficients from
non-Gaussian families.}

\item{effects}{Should parameters for fixed effects (\code{"fixed"}), random
effects (\code{"random"}), or both (\code{"all"}) be returned? Only applies
to mixed models. May be abbreviated. If the calculation of random effects
parameters takes too long, you may use \code{effects = "fixed"}.}

\item{component}{Should all parameters, parameters for the conditional model,
for the zero-inflation part of the model, or the dispersion model be returned?
Applies to models with zero-inflation and/or dispersion component. \code{component}
may be one of \code{"conditional"}, \code{"zi"}, \code{"zero-inflated"}, \code{"dispersion"} or
\code{"all"} (default). May be abbreviated.}

\item{keep}{Character containing a regular expression pattern that
describes the parameters that should be included (for \code{keep}) or excluded
(for \code{drop}) in the returned data frame. \code{keep} may also be a
named list of regular expressions. All non-matching parameters will be
removed from the output. If \code{keep} is a character vector, every parameter
name in the \emph{"Parameter"} column that matches the regular expression in
\code{keep} will be selected from the returned data frame (and vice versa,
all parameter names matching \code{drop} will be excluded). Furthermore, if
\code{keep} has more than one element, these will be merged with an \code{OR}
operator into a regular expression pattern like this: \code{"(one|two|three)"}.
If \code{keep} is a named list of regular expression patterns, the names of the
list-element should equal the column name where selection should be
applied. This is useful for model objects where \code{model_parameters()}
returns multiple columns with parameter components, like in
\code{\link[=model_parameters.lavaan]{model_parameters.lavaan()}}. Note that the regular expression pattern
should match the parameter names as they are stored in the returned data
frame, which can be different from how they are printed. Inspect the
\verb{$Parameter} column of the parameters table to get the exact parameter
names.}

\item{drop}{See \code{keep}.}

\item{verbose}{Toggle warnings and messages.}

\item{...}{Arguments passed to or from other methods. Non-documented
arguments are \code{digits}, \code{p_digits}, \code{ci_digits} and
\code{footer_digits} to set the number of digits for the output.
\code{group} can also be passed to the \code{print()} method. See details
in \code{\link[=print.parameters_model]{print.parameters_model()}} and 'Examples' in
\code{\link[=model_parameters.default]{model_parameters.default()}}.}
}
\value{
A data frame with p-values and compatibility intervals.
}
\description{
Compute p-values and compatibility (confidence) intervals for
statistical models, at different levels. This function is also called
consonance function. It allows to see which estimates are compatible with
the model at various compatibility levels. Use \code{plot()} to generate plots
of the \emph{p} resp. \emph{consonance} function and compatibility intervals at
different levels.
}
\details{
\subsection{Compatibility intervals and continuous \emph{p}-values for different estimate values}{

\code{p_function()} only returns the compatibility interval estimates, not the
related \emph{p}-values. The reasons for this is because the \emph{p}-value for a
given estimate value is just \code{1 - CI_level}. The values indicating the lower
and upper limit of the intervals are the related estimates associated with
the \emph{p}-value. E.g., if a parameter \code{x} has a 75\% compatibility interval
of \verb{(0.81, 1.05)}, then the \emph{p}-value for the estimate value of \code{0.81}
would be \code{0.25}. This is more intuitive and better to understand when looking
at the plots (using \code{plot()}).
}

\subsection{Conditional versus unconditional interpretation of \emph{p}-values and intervals}{

\code{p_function()}, and in particular its \code{plot()} method, aims at re-interpreting
\emph{p}-values and confidence intervals (better named: \emph{compatibility} intervals)
in unconditional terms. Instead of referring to the long-term property and
repeated trials when interpreting interval estimates (so-called "aleatory
probability", \emph{Schweder 2018}), and assuming that all underlying assumptions
are correct and met, \code{p_function()} interprets \emph{p}-values in a Fisherian way
as "\emph{continuous} measure of evidence against the very test hypothesis \emph{and}
entire model (all assumptions) used to compute it"
(\href{https://lesslikely.com/statistics/s-values/}{P-Values Are Tough and S-Values Can Help}).

This interpretation as a continuous measure of evidence against the test
hypothesis and the entire model used to compute it can be seen in the
figure below. The "conditional" interpretation of \emph{p}-values and interval
estimates implicitly (A) assumes certain assumptions to be true, thus the
interpretation is "conditioned" on these assumptions (i.e. assumptions are
taken as given). The unconditional interpretation (B), however, questions all
these assumptions.

"Emphasizing unconditional interpretations helps avoid overconfident and
misleading inferences in light of uncertainties about the assumptions used
to arrive at the statistical results." (\emph{Greenland et al. 2022}).

In other words, the term compatibility interval emphasizes "the dependence
of the \emph{p}-value on the assumptions as well as on the data, recognizing that
\emph{p}<0.05 can arise from assumption violations even if the effect under
study is null" (\emph{Gelman/Greenland 2019}).
