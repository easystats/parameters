\arguments{
\item{model}{Statistical Model.}

\item{ci_levels}{Vector of scalars, indicating the different levels at which
compatibility intervals should be printed or plotted. In plots, these levels
are highlighted by vertical lines. It is possible to increase thickness for
one or more of these lines by providing a names vector, where the to be
highlighted values should be named \code{"emph"}, e.g
\code{ci_levels = c(0.25, 0.5, emph = 0.95)}.}

\item{exponentiate}{Logical, indicating whether or not to exponentiate the
coefficients (and related confidence intervals). This is typical for
logistic regression, or more generally speaking, for models with log or
logit links. It is also recommended to use \code{exponentiate = TRUE} for models
with log-transformed response values. \strong{Note:} Delta-method standard
errors are also computed (by multiplying the standard errors by the
transformed coefficients). This is to mimic behaviour of other software
packages, such as Stata, but these standard errors poorly estimate
uncertainty for the transformed coefficient. The transformed confidence
interval more clearly captures this uncertainty. For \code{compare_parameters()},
\code{exponentiate = "nongaussian"} will only exponentiate coefficients from
non-Gaussian families.}

\item{effects}{Should parameters for fixed effects (\code{"fixed"}), random
effects (\code{"random"}), or both (\code{"all"}) be returned? Only applies
to mixed models. May be abbreviated. If the calculation of random effects
parameters takes too long, you may use \code{effects = "fixed"}.}

\item{component}{Should all parameters, parameters for the conditional model,
for the zero-inflation part of the model, or the dispersion model be returned?
Applies to models with zero-inflation and/or dispersion component. \code{component}
may be one of \code{"conditional"}, \code{"zi"}, \code{"zero-inflated"}, \code{"dispersion"} or
\code{"all"} (default). May be abbreviated.}

\item{keep}{Character containing a regular expression pattern that
describes the parameters that should be included (for \code{keep}) or excluded
(for \code{drop}) in the returned data frame. \code{keep} may also be a
named list of regular expressions. All non-matching parameters will be
removed from the output. If \code{keep} is a character vector, every parameter
name in the \emph{"Parameter"} column that matches the regular expression in
\code{keep} will be selected from the returned data frame (and vice versa,
all parameter names matching \code{drop} will be excluded). Furthermore, if
\code{keep} has more than one element, these will be merged with an \code{OR}
operator into a regular expression pattern like this: \code{"(one|two|three)"}.
If \code{keep} is a named list of regular expression patterns, the names of the
list-element should equal the column name where selection should be
applied. This is useful for model objects where \code{model_parameters()}
returns multiple columns with parameter components, like in
\code{\link[=model_parameters.lavaan]{model_parameters.lavaan()}}. Note that the regular expression pattern
should match the parameter names as they are stored in the returned data
frame, which can be different from how they are printed. Inspect the
\verb{$Parameter} column of the parameters table to get the exact parameter
names.}

\item{drop}{See \code{keep}.}

\item{verbose}{Toggle warnings and messages.}

\item{...}{Arguments passed to or from other methods. Non-documented
arguments are \code{digits}, \code{p_digits}, \code{ci_digits} and
\code{footer_digits} to set the number of digits for the output.
\code{group} can also be passed to the \code{print()} method. See details
in \code{\link[=print.parameters_model]{print.parameters_model()}} and 'Examples' in
\code{\link[=model_parameters.default]{model_parameters.default()}}.}
}
\value{
A data frame with p-values and compatibility intervals.
}
\description{
Compute p-values and compatibility (confidence) intervals for
statistical models, at different levels. This function is also called
consonance function. It allows to see which estimates are compatible with
the model at various compatibility levels. Use \code{plot()} to generate plots
of the \emph{p} resp. \emph{consonance} function and compatibility intervals at
different levels.

\examples{
model <- lm(Sepal.Length ~ Species, data = iris)
p_function(model)
