\description{
Bartlett's (1951) test of sphericity tests whether a matrix (of correlations)
is significantly different from an identity matrix. The test provides
probability that the correlation matrix has significant correlations among at
least some of the variables in a dataset, a prerequisite for factor analysis
to work. In other words, before starting with factor analysis, one needs to
check whether Bartlettâ€™s test of sphericity is significant.
