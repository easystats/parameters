#' @details \subsection{Small Sample Cluster corrected Degrees of Freedom}{
#' Inferential statistics (like p-values, confidence intervals and
#' standard errors) may be biased in mixed models when the number of clusters
#' is small (even if the sample size of level-1 units is high). In such cases
#' it is recommended to approximate a more accurate number of degrees of freedom
#' for such inferential statistics (see \cite{Li and Redden 2015}). The
#' *Between-within* denominator degrees of freedom approximation is
#' recommended in particular for (generalized) linear mixed models with repeated
#' measurements (longitudinal design). `dof_betwithin()` implements a heuristic
#' based on the between-within approach. **Note** that this implementation
#' does not return exactly the same results as shown in \cite{Li and Redden 2015},
#' but similar.
#' }
#' \subsection{Degrees of Freedom for Longitudinal Designs (Repeated Measures)}{
#' In particular for repeated measure designs (longitudinal data analysis),
#' the *between-within* heuristic is likely to be more accurate than simply
#' using the residual or infinite degrees of freedom, because `dof_betwithin()`
#' returns different degrees of freedom for within-cluster and between-cluster effects.
#' }
#' @seealso `dof_betwithin()` is a small helper-function to calculate approximated
#' degrees of freedom of model parameters, based on the "between-within" heuristic.
