## Breaking changes

* The default-method for effect sizes in `model_parameters()` for Anova-models

  functions like `model_parameters()` or `simulate_parameters()`.

## Changes to functions

### Printing model parameters

* `print()` for `model_parameters()` now names the coefficients column depending
  on the model type (i.e. `"Odds Ratios"` for logistic regression when
  `exponentiate = TRUE` etc.)

* `print()` for `model_parameters()` gains a `show_sigma` argument, to show or
  hide information on the residual standard deviation.

* `print()` for `model_parameters()` displays a message for Bayesian models,

  random sampling of test and training data.

* Revised `parameters_table()`, to improve readability of printed output.

# parameters 0.8.6

## Bug fixes

  associated vignette.

## Bug fixes

# parameters 0.7.0

## General

* We changed the computation of confidence intervals or standard errors, so
  these are now based on a t-distribution with degrees of freedom and not normal
  distribution assuming infinite degrees of freedom. This was implemented for
  most functions before and only affects few functions (like
  `equivalence_test()` or CIs for standardized parameters from
  `model_parameters()` when standardization method was `"posthoc"`).

## New supported models

* `averaging` (*MuMIn*), `bayesx` (*R2BayesX*), `afex_aov` (*afex*)

## New functions

* `check_heterogeneity()` as a small helper to find variables that have a
  within- and between-effect related to a grouping variable (and thus, may
  result in heterogeneity bias, see [this
  vignette](https://easystats.github.io/parameters/articles/demean.html)).

## Changes to functions

### `equivalence_test()`

* gains a `rule` argument, so equivalence testing can be based on different
  approaches.

* for mixed models gains an `effect` argument, to perform equivalence testing on
  random effects.

* gains a `p_values` argument, to calculate p-values for the equivalence test.

* now supports more frequentist model objects.

### `describe_distribution()`

* now works on grouped data frames.

* gains `ci` and `iterations` arguments, to compute confidence intervals based
  on bootstrapping.

* gains a `iqr` argument, to compute the interquartile range.

* `SE` column was removed.

### `model_parameters()`

* `model_parameters()` for Stan-models (*brms*, *rstanarm*) gains a
  `group_level` argument to show or hide parameters for group levels of random
  effects.

* Improved accuracy of confidence intervals in `model_parameters()` with
  `standardize = "basic"` or `standardize = "posthoc"`.

* `model_parameters.merMod()` no longer passes `...` down to bootstrap-functions
  (i.e. when `bootstrap = TRUE`), as this might conflict with
  `lme4::bootMer()`.

* For ordinal models (like `MASS::polr()` or `ordinal::clm()`), a `Component`
  column is added, indicating intercept categories (`"alpha"`) and estimates
  (`"beta"`).

* The `select`-argument from `print.parameters_model()` now gets a
  `"minimal"`-option as shortcut to print coefficients, confidence intervals and
  p-values only.

### Other changes

* `parameters_table()` and `print.parameters_model()` now explicitly get
  arguments to define the digits for decimal places used in output.

* `ci()`, `standard_error()`, `p_value()` and `model_parameters()` for *glmmTMB*
  models now also works for dispersion models.

## Bug fixes

* Fixed bug for `model_parameters.anova(..., eta_squared = "partial")` when
  called with non-mixed models.

* Fixed issue with wrong degrees of freedom in `model_parameters()` for *gam*
  models.

* Fixed issue with unused arguments in `model_parameters()`.

# parameters 0.6.1

## General

* Remove 'Zelig' from suggested packages, as it was removed from CRAN.

## Changes to functions

### model_parameters()

* `model_parameters()` now also transforms standard errors when `exponentiate =
  TRUE`.

* `model_parameters()` for `anova()` from mixed models can now also compute
  effect sizes like eta squared.

* `model_parameters()` for `aov()` gains a `type`-argument to compute type-1,
  type-2 or type-3 sums of squares.

* `model_parameters()` for Bayesian models gains a `standardize` argument, to
  return standardized parameters from the posterior distribution.

* Improved `print()` method for `model_parameters()` for nested `aov()`
  (repeated measurements).

* You can now control whether `demean()` should add attributes to indicate
  within- and between-effects. This is only relevant for the `print()`-method of
  `model_parameters()`.

## Bug fixes

* Fixed `model_parameters()` for `anova()` from *lmerTest* models.
