The *parameters* package, together with the [*insight*
package](https://easystats.github.io/insight/), provides tools to format the
layout and style of tables from model parameters. When you use the
`model_parameters()` function, you usually don't have to take care about
formatting and layout, at least not for simple purposes like printing to the
console or inside rmarkdown documents. However, sometime you may want to do the
formatting steps manually. This vignette introduces the various functions that
are used for parameters table formatting.

## An Example Model

We start with a model that does not make much sense, but it is useful for
demonstrating the formatting functions.

```{r}
data(iris)
iris$Petlen <- cut(iris$Petal.Length, breaks = c(0, 3, 7))
model <- lm(Sepal.Width ~ poly(Sepal.Length, 2) + Species + Petlen, data = iris)

summary(model)
```

## Formatting Parameter Names

As we can see, in such cases, the standard R output looks a bit cryptic,
although all necessary and important information is included in the summary. The
formatting of coefficients for polynomial transformation is difficult to read,
factors grouped with `cut()` always require a short time of thinking to find out
which of the bound (in this case, `Petlen(3,7]`, 3 and 7) is included in the
range, and names of factor levels are directly concatenated to the name of the
factor variable.

Thus, the first step would be to format the parameter names, which can be done
with `format_parameters()` from the *parameters* package:

```{r}
library(parameters)
format_parameters(model)
```

`format_parameters()` returns a (named) character vector with the original
coefficients as _names_ of each character element, and the formatted names of
the coefficients as values of the character vector. Let's look at the results
again:

```{r}
cat(format_parameters(model), sep = "\n")
```

Now variable names and factor levels, but also polynomial terms or even factors
grouped with `cut()` are much more readable. Factor levels are separated from
the variable name, inside brackets. Same for the coefficients of the different
polynomial degrees. And the exact range for `cut()`-factors is also clearer
now.

## Standardizing Column Names of Parameter Tables

As seen above, the `summary()` returns columns named `Estimate`, `t value` or
`Pr(>|t|)`. While `Estimate` is not specific for certain models, `t value` is.
For logistic regression models, you would get `z value`. Some packages alter the
names, so you get just `t` or `t-value` etc.

`model_parameters()` also uses context-specific column names, where applicable:

```{r}
colnames(model_parameters(model))
```

For Bayesian models, `Coefficient` is usually named `Median` etc. While this
makes sense from a user perspective, because you instantly know which type of
statistic or coefficient you have, it becomes difficult when you need a generic
naming scheme to access model parameters when the input model is unknown. This
is the typical approach from the *broom* package, where you get "standardized"
column names:

```{r eval=successfully_loaded["broom"]}
library(broom)
colnames(tidy(model))
```

To deal with such situations, the *insight* package provides a
`standardize_names()` function, which exactly does that: standardizing the
column names of the input. In the following example, you see that the
statistic-column is no longer named `t`, but `statistic`. `df_error` or
`df_residuals` will be renamed to `df`.

```{r}
library(insight)
model |>
  model_parameters() |>
  standardize_names() |>
  colnames()
```

Furthermore, you can request "broom"-style for column names:

```{r}
model |>
  model_parameters() |>
  standardize_names(style = "broom") |>
  colnames()
```

## Formatting Column Names and Columns

Beside formatting parameter names (coefficient names) using
`format_parameters()`, we can do even more to make the output more readable.
Let's look at an example that includes confidence intervals.

```{r}
cbind(summary(model)$coefficients, confint(model))
```

We can get a similar tabular output using *broom*.

```{r eval=successfully_loaded["broom"]}
tidy(model, conf.int = TRUE)
```

Some improvements according to readability could be collapsing and formatting
the confidence intervals, and maybe the p-values. This would require some
effort, for instance, to format the values of the lower and upper confidence
intervals and collapsing them into one column. However, the `format_table()`
function is a convenient function that does all the work for you.

`format_table()` requires a data frame with model parameters as input, however,
there are some requirements to make `format_table()` work. In particular, the
column names must follow a certain pattern to be recognized, and this pattern
may either be the naming convention from *broom* or the [*easystats*
packages](https://easystats.github.io/easystats/).

```{r eval=successfully_loaded["broom"]}
model |>
  tidy(conf.int = TRUE) |>
  format_table()
```

When the parameters table also includes degrees of freedom, and the degrees of
freedom are the same for each parameter, then this information is included in
the statistic-column. This is usually the default for `model_parameters()`:

```{r}
model |>
  model_parameters() |>
  format_table()
```

## Exporting the Parameters Table

Finally, `export_table()` from *insight* formats the data frame and returns a
character vector that can be printed to the console or inside rmarkdown
documents. The data frame then looks more "table-like".

```{r}
data(mtcars)
export_table(mtcars[1:8, 1:5])
```

Putting all this together allows us to create nice tabular outputs of parameters
tables. This can be done using *broom*:

```{r eval=successfully_loaded["broom"]}
model |>
  tidy(conf.int = TRUE) |>
  format_table() |>
  export_table()
```

Or, in a simpler way and with much more options (like standardizing, robust
standard errors, bootstrapping, ...) using `model_parameters()`, which
`print()`-method does all these steps automatically:

```{r}
model_parameters(model)
```

## Formatting the Parameters Table in Markdown

`export_table()` provides a few options to generate tables in markdown-format.
This allows to easily render nice-looking tables inside markdown-documents.
First of all, use `format = "markdown"` to activate the markdown-formatting.
`caption` can be used to add a table caption. Furthermore, `align` allows to
choose an alignment for all table columns, or to specify the alignment for each
column individually.

The following table has six columns. Using `align = "lcccrr"` would left-align
the first column, center columns two to four, and right-align the last two
columns.

```{r eval=successfully_loaded["broom"]}
model |>
  tidy(conf.int = TRUE) |>
  # parenthesis look better in markdown-tables, so we use "brackets" here
  format_table(ci_brackets = c("(", ")")) |>
  export_table(format = "markdown", caption = "My Table", align = "lcccrr")
```

`print_md()` is a convenient wrapper around `format_table()` and
`export_table(format = "markdown")`, and allows to directly format the output of
functions like `model_parameters()`, `simulate_parameters()` or other
_parameters_ functions in markdown-format.

These tables are also nicely formatted when knitting markdown-documents into
Word or PDF. `print_md()` applies some default settings that have proven to work
well for markdown, PDF or Word tables.

```{r}
model_parameters(model) |> print_md()
```

A similar option is `print_html()`, which is a convenient wrapper for
`format_table()` and `export_table(format = "html")`. Using HTML in markdown has
the advantage that it will be properly rendered when exporting to PDF.

```{r eval=successfully_loaded["gt"]}
model_parameters(model) |> print_html()
```

`print_md()` and `print_html()` are considered as main functions for users who
want to generate nicely rendered tables inside markdown-documents. A wrapper
around these both is `display()`, which either calls `print_md()` or
`print_html()`.

```{r eval=successfully_loaded["gt"]}
model_parameters(model) |> display(format = "html")
```
