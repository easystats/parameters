The
[`model_parameters()`](https://easystats.github.io/parameters/articles/model_parameters.html)
function (also accessible via the shortcut `parameters()`) can also be used to
calculate standardized model parameters via the `standardize`-argument. Recall
that standardizing data/variable (*z*-scoring), i.e. centering and scaling,
involves expressing data in terms of standard deviation (i.e., mean = 0, SD =
1). That is, it the process of subtracting the mean and dividing the quantity by
standard deviation. Standardization can help avoid multicollinearity issues when more complex (polynomial, for instance) terms are included in the model.

There are different methods of standardizing model parameters (see also [`?effectsize::standardize_parameters`](https://easystats.github.io/effectsize/reference/standardize_parameters.html)):

- `"refit"`,
- `"posthoc"`
- `"smart"` 
- `"basic"`

If you are interested in more statistical and technical details, and how standardization methods relate to different (standardized) effect size measures, read the following vignette from *effectsize* package, from whence this functionality comes:
<https://easystats.github.io/effectsize/articles/standardize_parameters.html>

## Standardization by re-fitting the model

`standardize = "refit"` is based on a complete model re-fit with a standardized
version of data. Hence, this method is equal to standardizing the variables
*before* fitting the model. It is the most accurate (Neter et al., 1989), but it
is also the most computationally costly and long (especially for heavy models
such as, for instance, Bayesian models). This method is particularly recommended
for complex models that include interactions or transformations (e.g.,
polynomial or spline terms).

When `standardize = "refit"`, `model_parameters()` internally calls
[`effectsize::standardize()`](https://easystats.github.io/effectsize/reference/standardize.html)
to standardize the data that was used to fit the model and updates the model
with the standardized data. Note that `effectsize::standardize()` tries to
detect which variables should be standardized and which not. For instance,
having a `log(x)` in the model formula would exclude `x` from being
standardized, because `x` might get negative values, and thus `log(x)` would no
longer be defined. Factors or dates will also *not* be standardized. Response
variables will be standardized, if appropriate.

```{r}
library(lme4)
data(iris)
set.seed(1234)
iris$grp <- as.factor(sample(1:3, nrow(iris), replace = TRUE))

# fit example model
model <- lme4::lmer(
  Sepal.Length ~ Species * Sepal.Width + Petal.Length + (1 | grp),
  data = iris
)

# classic model parameters
model_parameters(model)

# standardized model parameters
model_parameters(model, standardize = "refit")
```

The second output is identical to following:

```{r}
# standardize continuous variables manually
model2 <- lme4::lmer(
  scale(Sepal.Length) ~ Species * scale(Sepal.Width) + scale(Petal.Length) + (1 | grp),
  data = iris
)

model_parameters(model2)
```

## Post-hoc standardization

`standardize = "posthoc"` aims at emulating the results obtained by `"refit"`
without refitting the model. The coefficients are divided by the standard
deviation of the outcome (which becomes their expression *unit*). Then, the
coefficients related to numeric variables are additionally multiplied by the
standard deviation of the related terms, so that they correspond to changes of 1
SD of the predictor (e.g., "a change in 1 SD of `x` is related to a change of
0.24 of the SD of `y`"). This does not apply to binary variables or factors, so
the coefficients are still related to changes in levels.

This method is not accurate and tends to give aberrant results when interactions
are specified. However, this method of standardization is the "classic" result
obtained by many statistical packages when standardized coefficients are
requested.

When `standardize = "posthoc"`, `model_parameters()` internally calls
[`effectsize::standardize_parameters(method = "posthoc")`](https://easystats.github.io/effectsize/reference/standardize_parameters.html).
Test statistic and p-values are not affected, i.e. they are the same as if no
standardization would be applied.

```{r}
model_parameters(model, standardize = "posthoc")
```

`standardize = "basic"` also applies post-hoc standardization, however, factors
are converted to numeric, which means that it also scales the coefficient by the
standard deviation of model's matrix' parameter of factor levels (transformed to
integers) or binary predictors.

```{r}
model_parameters(model, standardize = "basic")
```

Compare the two outputs above and notice how coefficient estimates, standard
errors, confidence intervals, and *p*-values change for main effect and
interaction effect terms containing `Species` variable, the only factor variable
in our model.

This method is the one implemented by default in other software packages, such as `lm.beta::lm.beta()`:

```{r}
library(lm.beta)
data(iris)
model3 <- lm(Sepal.Length ~ Species * Sepal.Width + Petal.Length, data = iris)
mp <- model_parameters(model3, standardize = "basic")
out <- lm.beta(model3)

data.frame(model_parameters = mp$Std_Coefficient, lm.beta = coef(out))
```


## Smart standardization

`standardize = "smart"` is similar to `standardize = "posthoc"` in that it does
not involve model re-fitting. The difference is that the SD of the response is
computed on the relevant section of the data. For instance, if a factor with 3
levels A (the intercept), B and C is entered as a predictor, the effect
corresponding to B versus A will be scaled by the variance of the response at
the intercept only. As a results, the coefficients for effects of factors are
similar to a Glass' delta.

```{r}
model_parameters(model, standardize = "smart")
```
